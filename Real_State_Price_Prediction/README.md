# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Description:
This project aims to predict housing prices in Boston using a machine learning model. The dataset includes features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers.

## Key Steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and scaling features.
2. Model training: Used XGBoost Regressor to predict housing prices.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: Improved the model's performance.
4. Model evaluation: Achieved a best R² score of 0.92.

## Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- matplotlib

## Results:
The model successfully predicts house prices with high accuracy, as evidenced by the R² score of 0.92.

## How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
