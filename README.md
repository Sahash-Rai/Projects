# Machine Learning 

## Description
This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning . These projects serve as hands-on exercises for learning core machine learning techniques, including recommendation systems, object detection, price prediction, sentiment analysis, and more. They are ideal for beginners (like me) looking to explore the practical applications of machine learning algorithms.

## Projects

1. **![Hybrid Recommendation System Development](https://github.com/SahashRaee/Projects/tree/main/Hybrid%20Recommendation_System_Development)**  
   A hybrid recommendation system that uses both collaborative and content-based filtering to recommend items to users.

2. **Object Detection using Computer Vision**  
   A project focusing on object detection using OpenCV and deep learning, identifying objects in images and videos.

3. **Real Estate Price Prediction**  
   A machine learning model that predicts real estate prices based on various factors.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   An NLP project to perform sentiment analysis on text.

5. **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
   A project using machine learning to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
   
5. To Be Continued.....
