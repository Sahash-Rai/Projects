# Boston Housing Prediction Model

This project demonstrates the use of a **Linear Regression** model to predict housing prices based on the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to showcase how to build a simple regression model and evaluate its performance using **R-squared** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** metrics.

1. Description

The Boston Housing dataset contains information about various attributes of homes in Boston, including features like crime rate, average number of rooms, accessibility to highways, etc., and the target variable is the **price** of the house.

In this project:
- The data is preprocessed and scaled.
- A Linear Regression model is trained to predict housing prices.
- Model performance is evaluated using R-squared score and Mean Squared Error.

2. Installation

Make sure you have Python installed, then use the following command to install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas 
pip install sklearn 
pip install numpy 
pip install mapltolib
pip install seaborn



3. Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boston-housing-prediction.git
cd boston-housing-prediction
Run the script to train the model and evaluate its performance:
bash
Copy code
python housing_model.py
The model will output:

R-squared score: A metric that shows how well the model explains the variance in housing prices.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): A measure of the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Visualization of Actual vs Predicted prices will be displayed in a plot.

Evaluation
After running the model, you'll see the following metrics:

R-squared score: Indicates how well the model fits the data.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values.
For this project, a high R-squared score (e.g., 0.85) indicates that the model is doing a good job predicting housing prices.

### Key Notes:
- Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.
- The README assumes you're storing the Python code in a file called `housing_model.py`. If you use a different file name, just update the instructions accordingly.
  
Once you copy this to your GitHub repository, you'll have a neat and informative README that explains the project to others. Let me know if you need any changes or additions, bro!
