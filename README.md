# Machine Learning and AI Projects

## Description
This repository contains a series of projects exploring various machine learning and AI techniques. The goal is to provide hands-on implementations for common tasks like recommendation systems, object detection, price prediction, and sentiment analysis.

## Projects

1. **Hybrid Recommendation System Development**  
   This project focuses on building a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative and content-based filtering methods to recommend products to users.

2. **Object Detection using Computer Vision**  
   An object detection project using OpenCV and deep learning techniques to identify objects in images and videos. This project demonstrates the basics of image processing and computer vision.

3. **Real Estate Price Prediction**  
   A machine learning model that predicts real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. This project uses regression algorithms to analyze and forecast market trends.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   A natural language processing (NLP) project where sentiment analysis is performed on textual data, like product reviews or social media posts, to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
